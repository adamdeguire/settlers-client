# **Settlers Client (Full-Stack Project**

[**View the application here**](https://adamdeguire.github.io/settlers-client/)

## **Introduction**

-----------------------

This project is my first venture into full-stack development. I've created an **HTML**/**CSS**/**JavaScript** front-end single page application wherein a user can:

- **Sign up** with an email and password.
- **Sign in**, **sign out**, and **change passwords**.
- **Create**, **update**, and **save** games on a server.
- Play against and chat with others in real-time multiplayer via a **web socket**.
- Place game pieces on a common board accross all players.

### **The technical focus of this project is primarily on the following:**

- Client-Server communication via Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (**AJAX**)
- Client-to-client communication using **socket.io**
- DOM traversal and manipulation via **jQuery**
- Single Page Application (**SPA**) design
